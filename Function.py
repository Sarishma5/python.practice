# Functions in Python play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency, reusability, and organization of code.

# In Python, functions that operate with other functions â€” that is, take another function as an argument or return a function -  are called Higher-Order Functions. 
# They are particularly useful for processing various functions and returning specific results.

#The function is impure if it depends on any external state that it modifies or that affects its output. 
# This includes changing variables, or altering input arguments.
#  Such dependencies make the function's behavior unpredictable and dependent on the context in which it's run.
