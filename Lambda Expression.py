# lambda expressions - efficient feature in Python,
#  allowing you to create compact, throwaway functions without needing the formal structure of a standard function definition.

#  They are written in just one line using the lambda keyword and are often used for small, simple tasks.

# Lambda expressions are called anonymous functions. This means that:
# They don't need a name while being defined


#Lambda expressions perform a single operation and return a result.
# They are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by its arguments, a colon, and the expression to perform.

#You can provide arguments to lambda expressions on-the-fly by adding them in parentheses immediately after the lambda function.
#  The lambda expression should be also enclosed in parentheses.

#The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function. 
# Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:

#The filter() function, just like the map() function, takes in a function and an iterable as arguments. 
# The key purpose of filter() is to apply a condition specified in the provided function to each item in the iterable and return only those for which the function evaluates to True.

# Returns items that meet a condition:
