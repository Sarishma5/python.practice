#Built-in functions can save you a lot of work, 
# but youâ€™ll also need to create your own custom functions to solve specific tasks.

# To use your own functions, you need to define them first. 

 

# Once a function has been defined, you can call it as many times as you need.

 

# The greet() function below contains code to display a nice message when called

    print("hello rohan")

#function call

#A function can return an error if something goes wrong in its body.
#  Passing argument values in the incorrect data type is a common source of errors.

  #Python allows function arguments to have default values. If the function is called without the argument, the argument gets its default value
